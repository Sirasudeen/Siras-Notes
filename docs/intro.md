# 🧠 Welcome to My Mind Palace

Hey there!!! This is my personal little space on the web where I share what I’m learning, building, and figuring out.



##  Why I’m Doing This

Simple. I wanted a spot to keep track of what I learn and what I work on. Writing it down helps me, and if it helps someone else too, even better.  
Also, it’s a great way to stay consistent and see how far I’ve come.


##  What You’ll Find Here 📖

### 💻 Tech Things I’m Exploring

Thoughts, notes, and experiments with frontend, backend, databases, system design — whatever I’m playing with at the moment.

### 🧩 How I Solve Problems

Breakdowns of bugs, challenges, and tricky stuff I run into — and how I managed to untangle them (or didn’t).

### 🌱 Lessons & Life Stuff

Bits about productivity, career growth, and mindset shifts that made life or work a little easier.

### ⚙️ Things I’m Building

Side projects, experiments, half-baked ideas, and anything else I’m messing around with.
