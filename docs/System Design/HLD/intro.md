# High-Level Design

High-Level Design is about zooming out and thinking in terms of systems, how different components interact, and how to design something that’s scalable, maintainable, and actually works in production.

## Why I’m Learning This

So far, I’ve been more hands-on with low-level design and implementation. But as systems get more complex, it’s not enough to just know how to write good code but I also need to understand how to design systems that are reliable and can scale under real-world conditions.

That’s why I’ve started digging into high-level design. This space is my way of collecting everything I’m learning as I go.

## What This Will Cover

Right now, it’s a growing collection. You’ll find:

- My notes from system design resources
- Architecture diagrams I’ve sketched while learning
- Questions I’ve explored (and struggled with)
- Concepts like load balancing, caching, database sharding, and consistency models
- Use-case breakdowns of common systems like URL shorteners, social feeds, messaging apps, etc.

## A Work in Progress

This isn’t a polished library. It’s a learning log. I’ll keep updating this section as I study more, build more, and eventually start feeling more confident in designing large-scale systems from scratch.

If you’re learning HLD too...Welcome. Let’s figure it out.
