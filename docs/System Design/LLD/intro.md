# Low-Level Design

This section is about getting serious with how things are actually built. Not the 10,000-foot view of a system, but the in-the-trenches part that includes structuring code, designing classes, and writing components that work well together.

## Why Low-Level Design Matters

It's one thing to draw a system on a whiteboard. It's another to write the code in a way that's understandable, testable, and doesn’t collapse the moment the product grows.

Low-level design helps bridge that gap. It’s where solid architecture meets real-world constraints, like deadlines, teams, and legacy code.

If high-level design tells you **what** to build, low-level design focuses on **how** to build it — cleanly and correctly.

## What You’ll Find Here

This is where I document everything I’m learning and applying about low-level design. Expect a mix of:

- Practical applications of SOLID principles
- Design patterns that actually helped
- Mistakes I made and how I fixed them
- Java-based code examples and system walkthroughs
- Notes from LLD problems and mock interviews

## Who This Is For

Mainly, it’s for me to make sure I’ve internalized what I’m learning. But if you’re someone who enjoys clean architecture and thoughtful engineering, you might find something useful too.

This section will evolve as I grow — more examples, more structure, and maybe a few strong opinions. Let’s see where it goes.
