# 🛠️ What is System Design?

System Design is basically about **figuring out how to build scalable, reliable, and maintainable software systems**.  
It’s what happens after you know how to write code — when you need to think about how multiple parts of an application will work together when millions of people use it.

## 📌 Why It Matters  

When apps grow, they hit problems like:
- **Can it handle more users without crashing?**
- **How do we store and access data efficiently?**
- **What if a server fails — will the system still work?**

System design is about planning for these things *before* they become problems.

## 📖 What It Involves

- Choosing the right **architecture**
- Picking suitable **databases and storage options**
- Handling **scalability and load balancing**
- Making sure the system is **fault-tolerant**
- Optimizing for **performance and reliability**

## ✏️ What I’m Doing Here

This is where I’ll be noting down what I learn about system design — from basic concepts to the stuff I pick up while reading, building, or breaking things.

If you’re curious about the same stuff, feel free to tag along. 🚀
